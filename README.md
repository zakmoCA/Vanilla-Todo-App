# Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this simple application was to build foundations for DOM manipulation. In the process I was introduced to event listeners, dynamically appending/deleting elements, event propagation and local storage.

This application doesn't include any error/exception handling nor does it handle, and is very limited in function, but helped me understand DOM and local storage basics.

The app currently has basic functionality of adding task and deleting task, along with displaying task after refreshing due to local storage utilisation. In future I want to expand on this functionality and incorporate it into a more comlpex to do app based on Oliver Burkeman's 'closed vs open list' approach to to do lists. I will most likely be using either React or React native (would prefer building a mobile app I can use), or both (first in React then React Native).
